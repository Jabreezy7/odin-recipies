    <h3>Desciption</h3>
    <p>This is a Lebanese style chicken shawarma sandwich that is just <strong>bursting</strong> with flavor</p>
    <p><em>Fun Fact: </em>In the Greek cuisine, the popular Shawarma variation is called “gyros,” while in Armenian cuisine,
     the dish is better known as “tarna.” In Turkish cuisine, the recipe is familiar to people as döner kebab,
     all of which mean “turning.” They all refer to the nature in which the meat is cooked around an axis. </p>


     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>½ cup malt vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mixed spice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground cardamom</li>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>½ cup tahini</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>

        <li>4 cups shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>8 pita bread rounds</li>
     </ul>
     
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>In a glass baking dish, mix together the malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt,
            vegetable oil, mixed spice, cardamom, salt and pepper. 
            Place the chicken thighs into the mixture and turn to coat. 
            Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, 
            mix together the tahini, 1/4 cup yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, 
            olive oil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and adjust
            flavors if desired. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once.
            Uncover, and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken 
            is browned and cooked through. Remove from the dish, and cut into slices.</li>   
        <li>Place sliced chicken, tomato, onion, and lettuce onto pita breads.
            Roll up, and top with the tahini sauce.</li>
